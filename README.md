# Stat565_GenomicData_Project

Semester project based on cancer classification & clustering from gene expression monitoring.

Performed PCA on 7,123 human genes (found from microarrays data). 85% of the total variance was found to be explained by top 50 genes. Applied k-means clustering for analyzing cancer classes AML and ALL. Employed Elbow and Silhouette Score methods for the selection of k.
